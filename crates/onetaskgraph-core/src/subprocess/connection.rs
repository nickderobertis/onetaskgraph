//! One spawned plugin, and the one exchange at a time the engine has with it.
//!
//! The transport is deliberately hand-rolled, for the reason `engine/join.rs` gives for
//! its own combinator: this crate is written against `std::future` alone and runs on
//! whatever runtime its caller brings, so it may not reach for a runtime's process or
//! channel types. What it must not do instead is block: a blocking read inside an `async
//! fn` would stall every *other* source's future on the same task, and asking every
//! source at once is the property the engine is built on. So the blocking half runs on an
//! ordinary thread and the async half waits on [`Answer`], a one-shot that parks the
//! caller's waker until that thread has a line.
//!
//! Requests on one connection are serialized, which the protocol permits and §1.1 names
//! as the simpler correct choice. The concurrency that matters here is *across* sources,
//! and that is the caller's: the engine drives one future per source.
