//! A source's `routes`: where an item written to it goes instead, chosen by the item's
//! repositories.
//!
//! Engine-owned rather than plugin-owned: `routes` sits beside `plugin` and `config` in a
//! source's entry, and a plugin's own block never sees it. Every writer reaches the store,
//! so the rule is held here once rather than restated, and drifting, in each of them.
//!
//! An entry is one of three kinds. A **repository** entry, `{repositories, to}`, matches an
//! item when **every** one of the item's repositories matches at least one of its patterns;
//! an item with no repositories matches none. A **classification** entry,
//! `{classification, to}`, matches every item of that classification. A **combined** entry,
//! `{repositories, classification, to}`, matches an item of that classification every one of
//! whose repositories matches one of its patterns — and, like a repository entry, never an
//! item naming none.
//!
//! **Safety is decided before matching.** An item that may only be written somewhere
//! private is never placed in a source not declared private: for it, only entries sending
//! to a private source, or to one no layer gives a plugin, are tried. When none places it,
//! it stays in the source itself — and when that source is not private, the write is
//! refused there rather than sent anywhere less safe.
//!
//! **The kind decides the order, wherever an entry is written.** Among the entries an item
//! may try, combined entries are tried first, then classification entries, then repository
//! entries, each kind in the order written, and no match leaves the item in the source
//! itself. A placement names the entry by its index as written.
