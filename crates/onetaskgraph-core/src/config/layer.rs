//! Layers, and the pure merge that turns a stack of them into one configuration.
//!
//! Every layer — a document, the environment, the command line — is reduced to the
//! same thing: a list of *leaf* settings, each a dotted path, a value, and the
//! [`Origin`] it came from. Precedence is then one rule applied once, rather than a
//! per-verb `if flag.is_some()` at every call site, and "which layer did this come
//! from" is an answer the merge already holds instead of one reconstructed later.
//!
//! Nothing here touches the filesystem or the environment: a layer arrives as text
//! or as pairs, and [`merge`] is a function of its arguments. Reading is
//! [`super::discovery`]'s job and nothing else's.
