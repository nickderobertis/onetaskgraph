//! How a section link — a link to one heading of a record — is spelled on each kind of
//! destination, decided once.
//!
//! A copy re-points every link between the records of one project at the destination's own
//! records (see `engine::copy`). A link that names a heading as well as a record has a
//! second half, the fragment, and what a fragment has to say to land on a heading differs
//! by tracker: a Markdown file addresses a heading by its slug, a GitHub issue page only by
//! an anchor the body itself carries, and Linear only by the id its editor gave the heading.
//! So each destination kind has exactly one [`SectionForm`] entry here, and every path that
//! writes, recognises or counts a section link for that kind reads it:
//!
//! - [`SectionForm::cross`] and [`SectionForm::same`] write a link to a heading of another
//!   record, and of the body's own;
//! - [`SectionForm::spellings`], [`SectionForm::heading_of`] and
//!   [`SectionForm::same_record`] parse that kind's own form back into the location a source
//!   reports and a heading, so a body copied *out of* that kind is recognised exactly as an
//!   authored one is;
//! - [`SectionForm::markup`] is the markup a destination's bodies carry for its headings to
//!   be addressable at all, which only GitHub needs;
//! - [`SectionForm::inlines_reference_links`] says whether that kind keeps a reference-style
//!   link at all, which Linear does not.
//!
//! A heading is carried between them as its text and its position among the headings of
//! that text in its record ([`Heading`]), never as a slug, because the slug rules of GitHub
//! and Linear differ. The README's "Section links" is where these forms are stated for a
//! consumer.
