//! Content-keyed attestations: a record that someone cleared a task's, a project's or a
//! document's authored content against a bar, which goes void the moment that content or the
//! bar it was cleared against moves.
//!
//! This module is the one declaration of the shapes — [`Attestation`], [`AttestationCheck`],
//! [`ProjectAttestationCheck`] and [`Attested`] — that the command line answers with and both
//! SDKs are generated from, and of the digest a record is keyed on. The verbs that record and
//! check one are the engine's ([`crate::Engine::attest`] and its siblings).
//!
//! # The record
//!
//! An item holds its attestations under the reserved metadata key
//! [`MetadataKey::ATTESTATIONS_KEY`] (`onetaskgraph.attestations`): a JSON object mapping an
//! attestation kind to the one record of that kind, so recording a kind again replaces it:
//!
//! ```json
//! {"design-approval": {"kind": "design-approval", "by": "<attester label>",
//!   "at": "<RFC 3339>", "content_digest": "sha256:<hex>", "bar": "<fingerprint>",
//!   "note": "<optional text>", "excludes": ["<caller key>", "…"]}}
//! ```
//!
//! `note` is left out when none was given, and `excludes` when it is empty.
//!
//! # The digest
//!
//! `content_digest` is computed by the store, never handed to it: `sha256:` and the lowercase
//! hex SHA-256 of the canonical JSON (keys sorted at every depth, no insignificant whitespace)
//! of the item's **authored content**:
//!
//! - `title` and `content` (the body, `null` when it has none);
//! - `answers_digest`: the `answers_digest` of the item's `onetaskgraph.template` entry — the
//!   hash of the answers it was rendered from — or `null` for an item rendered from none;
//! - `repositories`, sorted;
//! - `depends_on`: the item's own forward dependency edges, each `[<edge kind>, <far end's
//!   kind>, <far end>]` sorted, where the far end is named by its lineage root: the qualified
//!   id the far end records at `onetaskgraph.lineage`, else at `onetaskgraph.origin`, else its
//!   own, for an item copied from nowhere. A copy files the far end under another id and
//!   records where it came from and the root that came from, so every copy of one far end
//!   names one root without any copy between them being read — or being there at all — while
//!   two items sharing a title never do. A document has none;
//! - `metadata`: every caller-owned metadata key and its value, but those the record
//!   `excludes`.
//!
//! Nothing else is in it: not the status, priority, labels, assets, location, id or version,
//! not any key of the reserved `onetaskgraph.` namespace — the attestations included — so an
//! item's attestation is not voided by recording another, and a copy, which carries every
//! member above and re-keys only what is left out, carries a record that stays true of its
//! copy.
//!
//! The attestation is deliberately policy-free: the store records and checks, and says
//! nothing about who may attest or which kinds anything requires.
