// llmlint: ignore-file[code_lands_in_the_domain_that_owns_it] This module is where the task that introduced templates fixes their library API: at `onetaskgraph-core`'s crate root, beside the engine every surface shares, so a Rust consumer renders without the binary. A crate of its own would be a new published sibling — a change to the release surface `release-targets.toml` freezes — which is not this change's to make.
//! Task templates: a minijinja document with a declared set of variables, rendered from
//! answers.
//!
//! # The format
//!
//! A template file is UTF-8 minijinja source, optionally opened by YAML front matter — a
//! first line reading `---`, closed by the next line reading `---`:
//!
//! ```yaml
//! ---
//! onetaskgraph_template: 1          # required when front matter is present
//! description: <string>             # optional
//! variables:                        # optional; name -> declaration
//!   <name>:                         # ^[a-z][a-z0-9_]*$
//!     description: <string>         # required, non-empty: what a prompt shows
//!     type: string                  # string | text | integer | boolean | list | object
//!     items: string                 # list only: string | object; default string
//!     required: true                # default: true without `default`, false with one
//!     default: <value of `type`>    # optional; `required: true` beside one is refused
//! ---
//! ```
//!
//! Nothing here restricts how the body uses a variable: it is minijinja, whole.
//!
//! # The chain
//!
//! `extends`, `include` and `import` resolve names over a [`TemplateLoader`]'s search path —
//! the directories it was given, in order, then the `(name, source)` pairs registered on it —
//! and never the working directory. The **declared set** is the union of every chain file's
//! front matter. When two files declare one variable, the file nearer the rendered one (fewer
//! references away from it, then loaded first) gives its `description`, `default` and
//! `required`; its `type` and `items` must be the other's, or the chain is refused naming both
//! files.
//!
//! # Rendering
//!
//! Strict: a name that is neither a declared variable nor set by the template fails the
//! render, naming the name and the file. No auto-escaping, trailing newlines kept,
//! `trim_blocks` and `lstrip_blocks` on. An optional variable given no answer and no default
//! renders as `none`.
//!
//! # The digest
//!
//! `sha256:` and the lowercase hex SHA-256 over, for each chain file in first-load order, its
//! resolved name, a NUL, its full bytes — front matter included — and a NUL. First-load
//! order is the order rendering reads the files — for the chain's own digest, rendering with
//! every variable at its default — the rendered file first, and a file named by an expression
//! where the render first reads it like any other; the files no render reads, in a branch it
//! did not take, follow in the order the chain names them.
//!
//! No prompting happens here. A caller that prompts asks [`Template::unanswered`] what is
//! left, puts the answers it gathers over the ones it had with [`Answers::overlay`], and
//! renders; the command line is the one caller that does.
