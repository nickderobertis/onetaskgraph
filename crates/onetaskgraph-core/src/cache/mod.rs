//! The store's local cache of remote sources.
//!
//! **Opt-in, one source at a time, and keyed on nothing but the change token a source gives.**
//! A source configured with `cache.enabled` has its tasks — each one's fields, metadata,
//! comments, assets and forward and reverse edges — its projects with their forward edges, its
//! documents with the manifest of their image assets, and the verified bytes of those assets kept
//! on this host, one file per item,
//! under a directory named for the remote it reads; `kinds` says how each kind beside a task's
//! is laid out. Every process that configures the same remote shares it: the
//! command line, both SDKs and a Rust caller of the engine.
//!
//! The rule it may never break is that **it never serves stale data**; what it costs is held over
//! an hour of the assumed workload, which it must spend fewer requests on than no cache, rather
//! than read by read. Freshness comes only from tokens the store already holds — a caller's pin, or the version a
//! listing in the same command carried — and an entry is served only when it is at that version
//! or a later one, by the ordering of the source that spelled both. Nothing expires by age, and
//! nothing asks the source whether something changed. A part of a task the source's token does
//! not cover is never served at all.
//!
//! **Releases of different ages share one directory**, so an entry it cannot read — an entry
//! schema it does not know, bytes that do not parse, another remote's — is a miss, never a
//! failure. Each entry is written whole to a staging file and renamed into place, so a reader
//! never sees part of one, and no lock is taken.
//!
//! This is the one place the store keeps a user's work outside the plugin that owns it, and
//! only because a configuration asked it to; `AGENTS.md` names it as that invariant's one
//! exception.
