//! The entries the cache keeps beside a task's: a project's, a document's, a task's and a
//! project's forward and reverse edges each read on their own, and the verified bytes of an image
//! asset.
//!
//! **Each kind lives in a directory of its own, named with its schema** — `projects-v3/`,
//! `documents-v3/`, `edges-v3/`, `reverse-edges-v3/`, `project-edges-v3/`,
//! `project-reverse-edges-v3/`, `bytes-v3/` — so an id cannot name one kind's entry for
//! another's, and a release writing this schema never writes over a file a release of another
//! schema wrote: that one lives in its own directory. Each entry still carries its schema, its
//! kind and the remote it is from, and a reader holds it to all three, so a file another release
//! or another remote left where this one looks is a miss.
//!
//! **A byte entry is named by its own SHA-256 and holds nothing else**, under a directory named
//! for the remote it was read from. It is written only when the bytes hash to that name and
//! served only when they still do, so a file truncated, corrupted or replaced is a miss and is
//! never answered with. What decides whether bytes are *served* is not here: it is the manifest
//! the caching source served at a covered version, which names the digest.
