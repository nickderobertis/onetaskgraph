//! A caching source: the plugin's own source, answering from the cache what a pin vouches for.
//!
//! The engine wraps every source configured with `cache.enabled` in one of these, so every read
//! path the engine has — `task show`, `show-many`, a comment listing and every read a copy
//! makes — meets the cache at one seam, and no verb decides for itself whether an entry is
//! fresh. Everything is forwarded to the plugin's own source except:
//!
//! - **A listing** of tasks, projects or documents is always sent, and each item it carries pins
//!   the reads of it that follow in the same command. It fills no entry.
//! - **A read by id** — a task's, a project's or a document's — is answered from the cache when
//!   it is pinned — by a caller, by a listing, or by a write expecting a version — and the entry
//!   is at that version or a later one, by the source's own ordering. Every other read is sent,
//!   and what it answered is written to the entry. A part the source's token does not cover is
//!   never served.
//! - **A task's forward edges** are served only where the source's token covers them: from the
//!   task's entry, or from an entry of their own kept at the version the source's dependency
//!   read spelled ([`TaskSource::edges_version`]). **A project's forward edges, and a task's
//!   and a project's reverse ones,** are served on the same terms from an entry of their own,
//!   where the source's coverage says its token covers them
//!   ([`ProjectVersionCoverage::forward_edges`], [`TaskSource::reverse_edges_coverage`]).
//! - **A task's comments** are served from the task's entry where the source's token covers
//!   them. A later page of comments is never served or kept, since no one page past the first is
//!   the whole of them.
//! - **An image asset's bytes** are served only for a manifest the cache holds at a covered
//!   version, by the digest it names, and only when the kept bytes still hash to it.
//! - **A write** is sent, and leaves every entry naming its item unserveable — and, where it can
//!   change a relation recorded on another item, every entry of the edges that relation reaches
//!   — unless it was an expected task write, when the source is primed with what the entry kept so it need not read
//!   first, and the entry is advanced to what the write's own last response showed whole, when it
//!   showed it.
