//! A write held to the version of the task it writes: `--if-version`.
//!
//! [`Engine::held_write`] runs a write inside a hold on one task and answers
//! [`EngineError::VersionMoved`] when the task was at any other version. The hold is task-local
//! to that one call, so concurrent held writes on one engine — of one task or of several — never
//! see each other's, and it is made good at the one place every call to a source passes —
//! `HeldOff`, which every ready source sits behind — on the first write of that task the call
//! sends, and nowhere after it: the writes a verb sends after its first are its own
//! continuation, not a competitor.
//!
//! How the check is made is the source's to say, through
//! [`TaskSource::holds_versions`](onetaskgraph_plugin_api::TaskSource::holds_versions): a source
//! that serializes its own writes checks inside the write, as one step with it; for any other,
//! `HeldOff` reads the task through the source immediately before the write and refuses there,
//! the time between that read and the mutation being the backend's residual race.
//!
//! A verb that ends up sending no write at all — every field already as named — is still held:
//! the task is read once afterwards, and a moved version refused, so a stale caller is told
//! whatever the write turned out to need.
