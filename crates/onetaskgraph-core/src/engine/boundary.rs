//! The public boundary: what may be written where, decided once for every writer.
//!
//! Every write this engine makes passes through here before its first mutation. Two facts
//! decide it, and the store owns only the first:
//!
//! - **Where it lands.** A source's configuration declares its `visibility`, and a source
//!   declared private is held to its backend's own live answer at every write
//!   ([`TaskSource::visibility`]) — read once per destination for a whole copy, before its
//!   first write, and held for its writes ([`Engine::hold_visibility`]). An item that may
//!   only be written somewhere private is written only there.
//! - **What it says.** A write reaching a destination that is not verified private is put to
//!   the caller's [`WritePolicy`], which decides whether its text names anything private.
//!   The store never derives a term itself, and never decides a repository's visibility
//!   itself: both are the policy's, so a linking caller supplies its own and the command line
//!   runs the commands `write_policy` names ([`CommandWritePolicy`]).
//!
//! **The boundary is active** when the configuration names a `write_policy`, when any source
//! declares a `visibility`, or when a linking caller supplies a [`WritePolicy`]
//! ([`Engine::with_write_policy`]). An inactive store still persists, copies and routes
//! classification, and still refuses an explicitly private item anywhere not declared private
//! — but it consults no repository's visibility and reads nothing extra before a narrow write,
//! so a store that has not opted in answers and spends exactly what it did before. A store that
//! wants repositories screened has to configure `write_policy` or declare a visibility.
//!
