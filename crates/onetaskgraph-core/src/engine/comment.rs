//! Comments on a task: the four verbs that read and write them, and the task detail
//! `task show` renders them in.
//!
//! Every verb here addresses exactly one task of exactly one source, so none of them fans
//! out, pages for a caller or compensates for anything. What they owe instead is the
//! refusals: a source declaring no comments is refused before anything is read, a source
//! whose comments cannot be written is refused before a write is attempted, and a task or a
//! comment that is not there is named rather than answered with an empty result.
//!
//! Nothing here writes anything down. A list walks the source's pages to the end and hands
//! the caller exactly what it read; a copy never reaches this module at all, which is what
//! keeps a copy from reading or writing a comment at either end.
