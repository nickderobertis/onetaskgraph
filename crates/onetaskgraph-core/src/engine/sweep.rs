//! `sources sanitize`: find the items of one source already carrying a declared private term,
//! and fix what replacement can.
//!
//! The terms are the policy's ([`WritePolicy::declared_terms`]) and nothing here matches one:
//! a search per term narrows which items are read, and every item read is put to the policy's
//! own sanitisation before anything is rewritten. A term, and any query built from one, is held
//! in memory for the sweep alone — never written to a report, a log, a cache key or standard
//! error.
//!
//! **Coverage is reported, never assumed.** A sweep that searches cannot establish three
//! classes of record: a hit only in stored metadata, which no search of this contract reaches;
//! a hit only in a comment, which no search of this contract reaches either; and a spelling the
//! policy matches but a backend's tokenizer does not. A search sweep names each under
//! `coverage.uncovered`. `--complete` reads the source whole — every item, page by page, with
//! its comments — and so covers all three; a source whose requests spend no quota, a folder of
//! Markdown, is always read whole.
//!
