//! Every comment one source's tasks hold that was made or edited since an instant, with the
//! watermark a later read may start from: `task comments <SOURCE> --since`.
//!
//! The listing is composed of what every source already answers — the task narrowing `task
//! list --commented-since` makes, walked to its last page, and each matching task's comments —
//! so it needs nothing new of a plugin but what only a plugin can say: who wrote a comment
//! ([`TaskSource::comment_author_kind`]), how long its reads may lag its writes
//! ([`TaskSource::comment_consistency_window`]), and the time its backend last stated
//! ([`TaskSource::served_at`]). The watermark is the earlier of that time and this host's clock
//! at the read's start, set back by the window, so a caller resuming from it never needs to know
//! a destination's lag: a comment the source had not yet shown is read on the next pass, and
//! one returned twice carries the same id and version both times.
//!
