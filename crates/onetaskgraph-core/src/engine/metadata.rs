//! One key of one record's metadata, set on its own.
//!
//! The three verbs — `task`, `project` and `document metadata set` — share one answer and one
//! path through the engine, which differ only in which of the source's three narrow writes is
//! called and what a missing record is called. Nothing here reads the record first: the
//! source's own write says whether it holds the record, and the record it answers with is
//! what the answer is read off, so what is reported is what the source now holds rather than
//! what it was handed.
//!
//! Metadata is not status, so no delivered task is re-evaluated after one of these writes.
