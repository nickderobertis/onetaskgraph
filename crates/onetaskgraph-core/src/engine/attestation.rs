//! Recording and checking attestations: the engine's half of [`crate::attestation`].
//!
//! Recording one is one read of the item — what its digest is computed over, and the version
//! `if_version` is held to — then one narrow metadata write of the whole
//! `onetaskgraph.attestations` entry, through the same seam `metadata set` writes through, so
//! a public write is screened exactly as that one is. A document's write takes the read rather
//! than reading again. Checking one is the read alone. A task's or a project's own forward
//! edges are read beside it, and each far end read once for the root of its chain of copies,
//! which the digest names it by. Where a source is declared private, a far end in a source
//! that is not, recording no root a copy out of a private source could have withheld, also
//! costs a query of each source declared private for the item linking to it
//! (`withheld_root`).
