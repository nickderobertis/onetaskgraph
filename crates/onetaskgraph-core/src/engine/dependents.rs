//! A dependency of a task in a source not declared private on a task in a source that is,
//! kept on the private side.
//!
//! A write anywhere not declared private withholds every id naming an item of a source that
//! is (see [`Engine::withholds`]), so the public task cannot hold such an edge itself: holding
//! it would name the private task where the private task must not be named. The private task
//! may name the public one freely, so the copy that withholds the edge records it there
//! instead, under [`DEPENDED_ON_BY_KEY`], and every read of the graph — `task deps` from
//! either end, `project graph`, and so the plan a caller loads from them — merges what the
//! private side records with what each source holds natively.
//!
//! The record lives in the private source's own store, at the user's explicit request — a
//! copy — and is read back only by asking that source again, so it is a write into a plugin
//! rather than state the engine keeps.
