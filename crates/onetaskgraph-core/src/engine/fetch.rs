//! Walking one source's stream, and merging the streams into the caller's page.
//!
//! # What "transient" means here, exactly
//!
//! A walk holds the caller's page plus **one** page of the source it is walking, and
//! nothing else. It never writes to a file, a database, an index or a value that
//! outlives the call: [`Fetched`] is a local, it is consumed by the merge below, and
//! what survives the response is the caller's page and an opaque resume state. That is
//! the whole of the mechanism behind "no work data outside a plugin" — the engine
//! re-asks rather than remembers, which is also why the same query asked twice reaches
//! the source twice.
