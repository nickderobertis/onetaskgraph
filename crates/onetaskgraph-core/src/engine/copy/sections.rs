//! A copied body's references and section links, written in the destination's form.
//!
//! [`BodyLinks`] is what a copy learns about one body before it writes it: the body as its
//! source holds it, the records of its project it names, and each one's headings. It is
//! rendered by [`BodyLinks::render`] against what the copy knows at that moment — each
//! referent's counterpart at the destination, where the body's own record lands, and the
//! heading ids a destination stored — and rendered again whenever the copy knows more,
//! because a counterpart created in this very copy, or a Linear record's heading ids, are
//! only known once it has been written. A link the copy cannot address yet is written as a
//! **placeholder**, the link exactly as the source spelled it, which
//! [`BodyLinks::finished`] replaces once nothing more will be learned.
//!
//! How a link is spelled on each kind is not decided here: every spelling, every parse back
//! and every markup is [`SectionForm`]'s.
