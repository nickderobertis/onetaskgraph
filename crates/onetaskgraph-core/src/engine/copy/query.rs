//! A task copy that names its items by a query rather than by id: `task copy --to` with the
//! narrowing `task list` takes.
//!
//! The query's own answer is what makes a repeat copy cheap. Every task it lists comes with
//! the change token its source gave, so a task whose token is the one its counterpart records
//! — and whose counterpart reads as the copy that left it — is reported `unchanged` with
//! `skipped: true` from the listing and the destination read alone, and nothing more of it is
//! read from its source, as long as that token covers every part the copy writes. Every other
//! task is read whole, the way a copy by id reads it.
//!
//! The query's comment activity is never handed to a source. A source that applies it reads
//! each candidate's comments to confirm it, and the copy would then read them again to carry
//! them; instead the copy confirms it from what it reads anyway — the comments it reads to
//! carry, or, for a task it skips, the copies of them the destination already holds. So no
//! task's comments are read from its source more than once in one invocation.
