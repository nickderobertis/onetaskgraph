//! What a `--comments` copy does to one task's comments at the destination, by one symmetric
//! rule that holds whichever way the copy runs.
//!
//! The copy makes the destination's **copies** of the source's comments match the source: it
//! adds a copy of each source comment the destination holds none of, edits a copy whose origin
//! comment changed, and deletes a copy whose origin comment the source no longer holds. Three
//! things are never done, and they are what make the rule safe in both directions:
//!
//! - A comment **native** to the destination — one carrying no origin — is never edited or
//!   deleted. A person wrote it there.
//! - A source comment that is itself a copy of a comment **on the destination task** is never
//!   sent back. So copying a local item back to the board it came from carries only the
//!   comments written locally, and never echoes the board's own.
//! - A copy whose origin names a task this source item does not vouch for — neither itself,
//!   nor the item it records as its own origin, nor a task any of its comments was copied
//!   from — is left alone: it came to the destination by some other copy.
//!
//! A comment's identity across copies is its [`CommentOrigin`]'s task and id, and a chained
//! copy keeps the *first* origin: a source comment that is a copy already carries its origin
//! on, so its copy two hops away still names the comment where it was written.
