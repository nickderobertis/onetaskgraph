//! Reading one task and its comments as one revision of it.
//!
//! A `--comments` copy writes a task and its comments together, so what it writes has to be
//! one state the source really held: never a body from before an edit beside comments from
//! after it. A task whose comments fit the first page is read whole in one request — the
//! detail read that names it — and is one revision by construction. One whose comments run
//! longer is read a page at a time, each further page through the same detail read, so every
//! request carries the task beside the page it answers. The pages are one revision when every
//! request carried the same task: the same change token where the source gives one, and
//! otherwise the same task in every member it reports.
//!
//! Where the source gives no token — Linear, and a GitHub task changed within the minute before
//! the read — the task's own members are all two page reads can be compared by, and a comment
//! edited alone between two pages moves none of them. So such a task whose comments run past
//! one page is read again in full until two consecutive passes agree on every comment, at most
//! [`FULL_PASSES`] of them; one that never settles is left unwritten and reported failed.
//!
//! When they disagree the task is read again from its first page, once. A second
//! disagreement is not chased further: the task is left unwritten and the copy reports it as
//! failed, because a read that keeps losing a race with a person editing the item would
//! otherwise spend an allowance every session on the host shares, without bound.
