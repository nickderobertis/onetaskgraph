//! Public projections: the neutral public views a project copy makes of a private
//! coordination project's public tasks, and the one map that ties each view to its canonical
//! task.
//!
//! **This module is the one definition of that map.** It lives on the private destination
//! project alone, at [`PublicProjections::KEY`], as
//! `{"schema_version": 1, "tasks": [{"task": "<source>:<id>", "projection": "<source>:<id>"}]}`:
//! `task` is the canonical task the private destination holds, `projection` its public view.
//! The copy that writes it, the re-copy that reads it back, the status mirror and both SDKs'
//! serialization tests all go through [`PublicProjections`], so no second spelling of the
//! shape exists to drift from this one.
//!
//! A projection is a **view**, never another executable task: it carries its canonical task's
//! screened title, content, repositories and status, its dependencies only on other
//! projections, and nothing else — no metadata, no origin, no link back, no name of the
//! private project. Everything it is made from is read from the canonical records on every
//! copy, so an edit made to a view is overwritten by the next copy and never reaches the
//! canonical graph.
