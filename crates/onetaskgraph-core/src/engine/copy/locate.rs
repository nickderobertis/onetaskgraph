//! `task locate`: where a copy of each task would land, which item there it would update, and
//! which repository a create would file its issue in — answered by the copy's own placement
//! and counterpart lookup, writing nothing.
//!
//! Nothing here restates a rule of the copy. Each task is read and classified by
//! [`Engine::placement_of`], which every copy places through; its counterpart is found by
//! [`Engine::target`] and its misrouting refused by [`Engine::misrouted`], which every copy
//! looks up through; a private task bound for a source not declared private is refused by
//! [`Engine::refuse_private_landing`], which every write is held to; the project it would be
//! filed under is [`Engine::counterpart`]'s; and the repository is the destination's own
//! [`TaskSource::creation_repository`](onetaskgraph_plugin_api::TaskSource::creation_repository),
//! which the GitHub Projects source answers from the rule its create applies. So a locate and
//! the copy after it cannot disagree.
//!
//! What it never does is what a copy does only to write: the caller's boundary check, a
//! destination's live visibility, an asset or a forward edge read.
