//! A create that is safe to retry.
//!
//! Every create a copy makes is preceded by an **intent** recorded on the item being copied,
//! at [`MetadataKey::CREATING_KEY`]: the create's deterministic key, when it was first taken,
//! which copy attempt holds it and until when. The created item carries the same key, at
//! [`MetadataKey::CREATE_KEY`] — or as its own id, on a source that takes an id of the caller's
//! choosing. The intent is removed in the write that records the item's
//! [`MetadataKey::COPIES_KEY`] link, so an item with no create in flight carries none.
//!
//! A copy that finds an intent for its destination resolves it before every other rule: it asks
//! the destination for the item carrying the key ([`TaskSource::created_with_key`]) and, found,
//! finishes and links that one instead of creating a second. A destination whose lookup by key
//! lags a create is given until the source's quiescence window after the intent was first taken
//! to list it, and only then is created in again, with the same key.
//!
//! Who owns an intent depends on the copy's source. An item whose source gives a hold on it
//! through `TaskSource::hold_item` — a folder of Markdown's exclusive lock file beside it — is
//! taken, renewed and released under that hold, so exactly one attempt on one host owns a create.
//! A source that gives none, as a hosted one does, leaves its intent advisory:
//! a live lease another attempt holds still refuses, but two attempts that read before either
//! wrote both proceed, and a destination whose lookup lags is listed again by key after the
//! create so a duplicate is reported rather than linked.
//!
