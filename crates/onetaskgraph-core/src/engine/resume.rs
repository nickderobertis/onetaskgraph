//! Where a walk resumes, per source and per stream.
//!
//! This is the inside of the engine's own [`PageToken`](crate::PageToken), and nothing
//! outside this crate names it. A source's [`Cursor`] passes through untouched — the
//! engine stores one and hands it back, exactly as a plugin stores nothing of the
//! engine's page token.
//!
//! The `skip` beside the cursor is the engine counting **its own** rows, never
//! interpreting the source's. It exists because compensation narrows a source page in
//! memory: a page of 50 that yields 7 surviving rows, of which the caller's page had
//! room for 3, has to resume at "the page beginning at this cursor, four surviving rows
//! in". The alternative would be holding the other four somewhere between calls, which
//! is exactly the caching this product does not do.
