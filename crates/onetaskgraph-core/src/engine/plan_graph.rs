//! A plan graph created in one call: a project, the member tasks its template declares — each
//! rendered from its own task template — and the `blocks` edges between them.
//!
//! The members arrive rendered and ordered ([`crate::template::Template::prepare_members`]), so
//! every answer a member's template refuses was refused before this is called and nothing was
//! written. Here the project is created first, then each member under it in the order given,
//! each as [`Engine::create_task`] creates one — its provenance recorded exactly as that verb
//! records it — offered its declared id, and depending on the members it names by the ids their
//! source actually gave them.
