//! What a destination stores of the content it is written, taken from each write's own answer.
//!
//! The content is sent as the copy, the create or the render composed it, with nothing
//! predicted of what the backend will do to it. The write's own answer then says what the
//! backend stores — [`TaskSource::stored_content`](onetaskgraph_plugin_api::TaskSource::stored_content)
//! — and where that is what was sent the write is done. Where it is not, every fingerprint the
//! item keeps is recomputed over the stored content: a rendering's `body_digest`, moved onto it
//! only where the provenance vouched for what was sent, and a copy's
//! `onetaskgraph.copied_destination_version`. One follow-up write sends the stored content back
//! verbatim beside them, as its own request, and its own answer has to report that content
//! again; a backend that rewrites its own stored content is refused as `stored-content-diverged`.
//! No read of the item follows either write: the answers are the record.
