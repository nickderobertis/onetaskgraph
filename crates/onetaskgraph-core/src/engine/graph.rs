//! `project graph`: one project's tasks and the dependency edges between them, laid out
//! once and handed back in the two forms the verb prints.
//!
//! The layout is the contract, and it is stated whole in the verb's own `--help`, which the
//! README carries verbatim: the order the nodes come in, how they are numbered, the order of
//! the edges, which way `auto` lays the graph out, how a group is read off a task's metadata
//! and how a label is escaped. Everything below is a function of what the project's source
//! reports and of the request, so two calls over an unchanged project agree byte for byte.
//!
//! Nothing is written down: the tasks are read through the source's own project listing and
//! each task's forward edges through its own dependency read, exactly as `task list
//! --project` and `task deps` read them, and the whole graph lives for one call.
