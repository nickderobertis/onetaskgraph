//! Relations between tasks: a task's parent, and typed links between two items.
//!
//! A **parent** is a task of the child's own source, many-to-one and multi-level, held where
//! the source holds it — a GitHub sub-issue under `sub_issues: parent`, a Linear `parentId`, a
//! stored field on a folder of Markdown or an in-memory source — and written through
//! [`TaskSource::set_parents`], one answer per edge.
//!
//! A **link** is a type name over a directed pair of items. Its authority on every plugin is
//! the store's own metadata on both endpoints, under [`TaskLink::METADATA_KEY`], beside a
//! `## Links` section rendered into the item's content and stripped on every read; all of one
//! item's links in a call go in one targeted update ([`TaskSource::update_tasks`]), held to the
//! version this call read it at. A type a source's `link_types` mirrors natively is also
//! written as the destination's own relation, between two tasks of that source, and removed
//! only with the last mirrored link between that pair.
//!
//! The documents read and answered here are declared once, in this module, and published as
//! roots of the schema bundle, so both SDKs model them from these types.
