//! Turning a configuration into live sources.
//!
//! Two steps, deliberately separable. [`validate_sources`] runs at load, for every
//! verb, and refuses a source whose `config:` block does not match the schema its
//! plugin declares — the plugin itself is already one this build has, because
//! [`SourceConfig::plugin`] is a [`PluginKind`](crate::PluginKind) and no other kind
//! can be represented. [`resolve`] then
//! builds the sources a command actually needs. The order is the point: a typo in a
//! per-source field is refused while the user is still looking at the file that
//! caused it, rather than surfacing as a confusing failure inside the first HTTP
//! call that source makes.
