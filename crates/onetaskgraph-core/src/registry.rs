//! The compile-time registry of plugin kinds.
//!
//! Every plugin this build compiled is named here. The two that reach a network —
//! `github-projects` and `linear` — are each behind a cargo feature of this crate that no
//! default enables, because a host that wants only a local store must not compile an HTTP
//! and TLS stack it never runs. A kind this crate could register but this build left out is
//! still known by name, so a configuration naming it is refused with the feature that
//! enables it rather than as a plugin nobody has heard of.
