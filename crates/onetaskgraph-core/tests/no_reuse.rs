//! The half of "no work data outside a plugin" a filesystem scan cannot see.
//!
//! The sandboxed sentinel journey in the binary's suite proves nothing was *written
//! down*. It cannot prove the engine did not answer a second identical query out of
//! something it kept in memory for the life of the process — that leaves no file behind
//! and no crate in `deny.toml`'s ban list, and it is exactly what an ordinary
//! "let's not hammer the API" change would introduce.
//!
//! So this asks the same question twice through one engine and counts what the source
//! was asked. An engine that answered the second one from memory fails here.
