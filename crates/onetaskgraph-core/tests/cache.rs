//! The shape of what the store's local cache writes, held to the schema number every entry
//! carries.
//!
//! The cache directory is shared by every release on a host, and a reader trusts an entry of
//! its own schema number as one it can read. So a change to what an entry holds that keeps the
//! number would have one release read another's entries as its own — the one failure a schema
//! number exists to prevent. Each number is recorded beside a digest of the shapes it publishes;
//! the table is append-only, and a shape changed without a new row fails here.
