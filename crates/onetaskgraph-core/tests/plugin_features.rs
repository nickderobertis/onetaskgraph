//! The two network plugins are cargo features of this crate, and no default enables them.
//!
//! Two halves, proven against the real thing rather than by reading the manifest. What a
//! dependent links is asked of cargo itself: a crate outside this workspace takes the engine
//! by path, and `cargo tree` resolves it with the lockfile this workspace ships, once with
//! the default features and once with both network features — the second being what shows
//! the first could have failed. And what a build without them does with a configuration
//! naming one is asked of the engine's own two front doors, the configuration document and
//! the subprocess serve loop, each of which has to name the feature that would compile it.
//!
//! This file runs twice in this crate's `test` target: under `--all-features` like every
//! other test here, and on its own with the default features, which is the only build in
//! which the refusals below exist.
